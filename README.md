# Zippys
This repository contains some components I built while working on the Zippy's project. Zippy's is a successfull hawaiian restaurant chain that we were building their new website, here are some the react components I made for the project

At this website, I used React, nextJs and TalwindCss for the styling. For the Design, Figma.

##Customer Infomation
This Component is for the Customer Information styles and validating the inputs for the user. At this part we have two scenarios, because the user can have two dispatch options, Pickup Or Delivery. So In the Pics we have the two Design Options, the delivery one has 2 more inputs, "Delivery Address" and "Delivery Instructions"
